# Short version

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in Bioinformatics, specialising in transcriptomics analysis (`RNA-seq`, `scRNA-seq`). I have worked on a wide range of data modalities including but not limited to (`ATAC-seq`, `scATAC-seq`, `ChIP-seq`, `variant calling on WES data`). I use `Docker` and `git` on a daily basis, write my Bioinformatics workflows primarily in `WDL`, and do my bioinformatics scripting and analysis work in `Bash`, `R` and `Python`.

Previously, I was a wet-lab developmental biologist in Cambridge who discovered a passion in Bioinformatics during my Ph.D as I was analysing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets ("So you are a bioinformatician now?" - Ph.D. supervisor, 2021, over lab dinner).

# Longer version

I graduated top of my cohort from the University of Cambridge in 2017, where I obtained my B.A (Hons) with a specialisation in Genetics. I chose Genetics back, inspired by a series of lectures on the cell-fate decision making process of bacteriophage lambda delivered by Prof. Alfonso Martinez Arias. I then read "The Genetic Switch" by Mark Ptashne, which absolutely blew my mind: a tiny virus **can** do all that?! (In this (post-?) Covid age, my surprise seems rather naive)

After a fun summer internship as the first student in Dr. Ben Steventon's lab, I stayed on for a Ph.D. in Genetics with the [Steventon Lab](https://steventonlab.wordpress.com/). Then, I worked in the field of developmental biology and wrote my [thesis](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/331309?show=full) on the cell-fate decision making process of neuromesodermal progenitors (NMps) in the zebrafish tailbud. My favorite part of the Ph.D. was having the freedom to explore a range of things without consequences - dabbling in cell culture work constructing "gastruloids" with the Martinez-Arias lab (I realise I don't enjoy coming in on Saturday-Sundays and pipetting), theoretical discussions about the role of stochasticity in cellular decision making (I love theoretical discussions),  writing Python code to implement a stochastic toggle switch and reading up on stochastic calculus etc (I like equations).

Hence, over the course of my Ph.D., I found out that I am really joyful when I get to code and think about math equations, since I really enjoy this kind of abstract thinking that carry practical implications. So much for the notion that "biologists can't do math". Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow in Bioinformatics at the Cancer Science Institute (CSI), National University of Singapore. Here, I work in the [genomics core facility](https://gedac.org) to provide customised bioinformatics consultation to CSI researchers, and to develop scalable bioinformatics workflows in the cloud that runs on the AWS serverless infrastructure.

I love my work because it gives me the chance to opportunity to work and collaborate on a diverse range of different projects, each with its own unique challenge, and so I feel like a have a healthy dose of intellectual stimulation each day.

My favorite part about Bioinformatics is the breadth of knowledge required. As a person who loves learning a lot, I always have the excuse ("I need to know this because it's important for my work!!") to sharpen these technical skills:

- Biological expertise: to converse with experimental biologists and catch up on the relevant biological literature
- Statistical expertise: to provide feedback on statistical methods and understand how methods differ from one another
- Programming expertise: to write analysis scripts, run tests, launch pipelines in the cloud, make pretty plots.
- Computer Science expertise: to appreciate the inner workings of algorithms, navigate file systems,
And much much more.

I started this personal blog as a way of keeping track of what I learnt, and to summarise and
share them with the world.

In my free time, I play chess (a lot of [chess](https://lichess.org/@/bompipi95)). You can probably find me playing in local weekend chess tournaments in Singapore. So if you do, send me a challenge!
