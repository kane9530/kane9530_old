## Work 

My name is Kane Toh (Chinese: 秦全). I am an incoming postdoctoral research fellow in Bioinformatics at the Cancer Science Institute (CSI), National University of Singapore. I obtained my Ph.D. in Genetics at the University of Cambridge where I worked with Dr. Ben Steventon in the [Steventon Lab](https://steventonlab.wordpress.com/).
